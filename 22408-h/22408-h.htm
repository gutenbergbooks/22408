<p class="cap">A</p><p>S the lion is called the king of beasts, so the eagle is called the
king of birds; but except that it is bigger, stronger, and swifter than
other birds, there does not seem much reason for the name. It is a
mistake to attribute noble or mean qualities to animals or birds, or to
think they can do good or bad actions, when they can only do what God
has created them to do, and as their instinct teaches.</p>

<p>The most powerful of the eagles is the Golden Eagle, so called because
of the rich yellowish-brown bordering to its feathers. It makes its nest
in the clefts of the rocky sides of the mountains, and seldom on a tree,
unless where one has sprung up in between the clefts, and the tangled
roots make a sort of platform. This the eagles cover with sticks, and
here they make their house, living in it always, and not only when they
lay eggs or have young ones.</p>

<p>If there are eaglets in the nest, the food is at once carried home to
them, and the skinning and eating done at home. Eagles are very
attentive to their young, and feed them with great care until they are
able to take care of themselves.</p>

<p class="cap">M</p><p>RS. ZEBRA, standing with her baby by her side, asks proudly of the
lookers-on, &ldquo;Did you ever see such a likeness?&rdquo;  and certainly mother and
child are very much alike, striped all over their bodies, from head to
foot, and from nose to tail, with the same regular marks of black.
Strong and wild by nature, the zebra family are left very much to
themselves, which is a source of great happiness to the mother and child
in the picture before us. &ldquo;No! no! my baby is not going to become as
tame as the donkey, or to draw carts and carriages like the horse; it is
to have its freedom, and go just where it likes all over these large
plains;&rdquo;&mdash;so says Mrs. Zebra, and she means it too, for if anybody took
the trouble to go all the way to the hot country of Africa, where Mrs.
Zebra is at home, and tried to carry off her baby, they would find their
journey a vain one, and that she would kick severely, and perhaps break
the legs of the person bold enough to take away her darling.</p>

<p class="cap">H</p><p>IS is the American black bear, who is looking so lively and seemingly
inviting the young folks to have a romp, which they will be only too
willing to join in. The black bear is of a timid disposition, and seldom
attacks man except in self-defense. The female bear is a most
affectionate mother, and many stories are related showing her care and
love for her young, and her sorrow and mournful cries when any evil
befalls them. On one occasion a black bear with her two cubs was pursued
across the ice by some armed sailors. At first she urged her cubs to
increased speed, but finding her pursuers gaining upon them, she
carried, pushed, and pitched them, alternately, forward, until she
effected their escape from her pursuers.</p>

<h2><a name="LITTLE_OWLS" id="LITTLE_OWLS"></a>LITTLE OWLS.</h2>


<p class="cap">W</p><p>HO has not at one time or other of his life read fairy tales and
sympathized with stories of enchanted princes and princesses? I once
thought of this when a country boy offered me a nest with four of the
young of the Little Owl. I put them into a large cage, where they could
stare at each other and at my pigeons to their hearts' content.</p>

<p>Let me say that this little owl is a very useful bird, for it keeps
mice, bats, beetles, and other creatures in check, which might otherwise
multiply too fast. On a spring or summer evening you may hear its
plaintive hoot among the apple-blossoms of an orchard, or the sheaves of
a cornfield. Curiously enough, this simple sound earned the little bird
the name of being the harbinger of death, and peasants believed that
whenever its cry was heard where sickness was in the family, the patient
was sure to die.</p>

<h2><a name="AUROCHS" id="AUROCHS"></a>AUROCHS.</h2>


<p class="cap">A</p><p>N Aurochs in blind rage, charging through thick and thin, has had a
fascination for me as long as I can remember. The true aurochs and this,
the European Bison, ceased to exist in the British Isles, except in the
Zoological Gardens; but the latter is still found wild in Lithuania, and
is also carefully preserved in other parts of Russia, of which the
Emperor has a herd. There is much talk about their being untamable&mdash;that
they will not mix with tame cattle&mdash;that tame cows shrink from the
aurochs' calves; but does not any cow shrink from any calf not her own?
The American Bison, with which you are all pretty familiar, is very
similar to the one just mentioned. There have been several attempts made
to domesticate the American bison, and have been so far successful. The
size and strength of the animal make it probable that if domesticated,
it would be of great use.</p>

<p class="cap">W</p><p>ELL,&rdquo;  said little Herbert Joyce, as he looked over the books of
drawings which his cousin had just brought home from Australia, &ldquo;I never
saw anything so extraordinary before in all my life; why here is an
animal with three heads, and two of them are very low down, and much
smaller than the others.&rdquo; &ldquo;What do you mean, Herbert?&rdquo;  asked his cousin,
who just then came into the room. &ldquo;There are no three-headed
animals&mdash;let me see the picture. Oh! no wonder you were puzzled; it does
look like a queer creature. That is a kangaroo, and the small heads
belong to her children, whom she carries about in a bag formed by a hole
in her skin, until they are old enough to walk; and the little things
seem very happy there; and sometimes, as their mother moves along over
the grass, you may see them nibbling it.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="SWANS" id="SWANS"></a>SWANS.</h2>


<p class="cap">T</p><p>HIS beautiful and majestic bird was considered the bird-royal in
England, owing to a law of England that when found in a partially wild
state on the sea and navigable rivers it belonged to the crown; but of
course it is to be found on the ponds and lakes of many a gentleman's
estate, and is always prized as a great ornament to the lake. The swan
is also very valuable in clearing the ponds of weeds, and makes a most
effective clearance, as they eat them before they rise to the surface.
The swan affords a pleasing illustration of the love of the mother-bird
for its young, and has been known to vanquish a fox who made an attack
on its nest&mdash;showing that the instinct of motherhood kindles boldness
and bravery in the breast of the most timid animals. The nest is
generally made on an islet, and composed of reeds and rushes, and when
the five or seven large eggs are hatched, the mother may be seen
swimming about with the young ones on her back.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_SEA_LION" id="THE_SEA_LION"></a>THE SEA LION.</h2>


<p class="cap">A</p><p>LTHOUGH such large and powerful creatures, these sea lions are innocent
and playful. See, one of them has reared himself up on his hind legs, if
legs they may be called, and is sitting on a chair with his flappers
over the back of the chair. It inhabits the eastern shores of
Kamtchatka, and is in some places extremely abundant, and measuring
about fifteen feet in length. It is much addicted to roaring, which, as
much as the mane of the old males, has obtained for it the name of the
Sea Lion. The old males have a fierce appearance, yet they fly in great
haste on the approach of man, but if driven to extremities they will
fight desperately; but in captivity they are capable of being tamed, and
become very familiar with man. The scientific name of the sea lion is
Otary.</p>

are here given. Little do visitors to the gardens take into account how
much a wild animal goes through till it has got used to a state of
things so opposite to its natural habits. Their wants are attended to as
much as possible, but cannot be always met; and so we have here a
devoted mother, worn out by the demands of her cubs, and vainly anxious
to hide herself from daylight and man's gaze. She has long given up
trying to dig or scratch her way out. All she can do is to lean against
the wall, ready for a last defence, should anybody come within her
prison. She dares not curl up into a ball, like the one cub, and go to
sleep; while this little careless imp on her back, happy and trustful,
adds to her tiredness by his weight.</p>

of the bark of the tree in which the nest is built, proves that the bird
intended it should not be easily discovered. In some nests, hair, wool,
and rushes are cleverly interwoven. In others, the parts are firmly
fastened by a thread, which the bird makes of hemp, wool, hair, or, more
commonly, of spiders' webs. Other birds&mdash;as, for instance, the blackbird
and the lapwing&mdash;after they have constructed their nests, plaster the
inside with mortar; they then stick upon it, while quite wet, some wool
or moss to give warmth; but all alike construct their nests so as to add

to decide which are really friendly and which are really hostile to
man's interests. The actual fact appears to be that there is neither
hostility nor friendship. If farmers and gardeners kill off too many
birds, nature revenges herself by sending a plague of insects which the
small birds, if alive, would have eaten. Gamekeepers ruthlessly shoot
hawks and kites, or snare stoats and polecats, with the result that
their game grows up too thick for its feeding ground, sickly specimens
are allowed to linger on, and a destructive murrain follows. The rook,
no doubt, is fond of eggs; but nevertheless he does the farmer good
service when he devours the grubs which are turned up by the plow; and
as the salmon disease, which of late has proved so destructive, is
attributed by the best authorities to overcrowding, that glossy-coated
fisherman, the otter, is really a benefactor to the followers of Izaak
Walton's gentle craft.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 13.8em;">HE carrier pigeon is remarkable for the degree in which it possesses
the instinct and power of returning from a distance to its accustomed
home. In Eastern countries it is the practice to bathe the pigeon's feet
in vinegar to keep them cool, and to prevent it from alighting in quest
of water, by which the letter might sustain injury. Pigeons intended for
this use must be brought from the place to which they are to return,
within a short period, and must be kept in the dark and without food for
at least eight hours before being let loose. The carrier pigeon was of
great service during the siege of Paris in 1871, and conveyed many
important messages. It goes through the air at the rate of thirty miles
an hour, but has been known to fly even faster.</p>

rapid, and irregular. The eggs, which are four in number, are deposited
on the ground. In the snipe, and all its immediate allies, the bill is

the dense prickly furze hides their retreat, whilst it affords them a

For this reason, when we wish to say that a person can see very clearly
or can look beyond the outward appearance of things, we call him
<i>lynx-eyed</i>. Like all cats, the lynx possesses in his mustache a very
correct power of feeling. This, with the sense of hearing and sight,
guides him in all his expeditions.</p>

<p>The lynx in the picture is in the act of springing upon a timid hare.
Although he can measure twenty paces in a jump, I think for once he has
made a misstep, and the dear little creature with one more bound will be

several together, and one starts over the snow in pursuit of booty, all

<p class="cap">T</p><p>HIS industrious animal is generally found in Canada and the northern
portions of the United States, where it makes its home on the banks of
the rivers and lakes. Here they assemble in hundreds to assist each
other in the construction of their dams, and in the building of their
houses, which are put together with a considerable amount of engineering
skill. The materials used in building the dams are wood, stones, and
mud, which they collect themselves for that purpose, and after finishing
the dam, or winter storehouse, they collect their stores for the
winter's use, and then make a connection with their houses in the banks.
Their skins are valuable in making fine hats, and their flesh is much
relished by the hunters. The beaver is an interesting animal in many
respects, and the expression &ldquo;busy as a beaver&rdquo;  is borne out by its
habits.</p>

months, and at the age of eighteen months it is very considerably
developed, and they begin to roar. Both in nature and in a state of

by a very trifling motion of the edge of his back fin&mdash;sometimes resting
a little on the tips of his two foremost fins, as they touch the ground,
carefully calculating his distance; and then, at the very moment when
the minnow has got into a position which leaves a space of clear water

yellow-lined beaks, singing to their hearts' content. Whole families
would perch there together, or the young would rest in rows of four or
five, according to the nest-broods of each. How delightful to see them

journey in flocks from fifty to a hundred, and rise to an immense height
in the air, uttering their loud harsh cries, and occasionally alighting

do sad havoc to the crops, several doing sentinel duty while the

the same gentleman presented the elephants and rhinoceroses in the
Zoological Gardens with globes for diversion suited to their sizes, but
it seems the elephants took to playing ball so furiously, that 'there
was danger of their houses being swept down altogether; so they were
forbidden to use them indoors.' The polar bear was given a toy which, we

standing on their hind feet, stuck their front claws firmly into the

HE Argus is a bird with magnificent plumage; it inhabits the forests of
Java and Sumatra, and takes its place beside the pheasant, from which it
only differs in being unprovided with spurs, and by the extraordinary
development of the secondary feathers of the wings in the male. The tail
is large and round, and the two middle feathers are extremely long and
quite straight. When paraded, as it struts round the female, spreading
its wings and tail, this bird presents to the dazzled eye of the
spectator two splendid bronze-colored fans, upon which is sprinkled a
profusion of bright marks much resembling eyes. It owes its name of
Argus to these spots.</p>

<p class="cap">O</p><p>NE summer's day on the banks of the river Tweed, in Scotland, a fox sat
watching a brood of wild ducks feeding in the river. Presently a branch
of a fir tree floated in their midst, which caused them to rise in the
air, and after circling round for some time, they again settled down on
their feeding ground. At short intervals this was repeated, the branch
floating from the same direction, until the ducks took no further notice
of it than allowing it to pass by. Mr. Reynard noticed this; so he got a
larger branch than the others, and crouching down among the leaves, got
afloat, and coming to the ducks, who took no notice of the branch, he
seized two of the ducks, and then allowed himself to be floated to the
other side, where, we suppose, he had a repast.</p>

Elephants, the Indian and African; the ears of the latter are much
larger than the Indian, covering the whole shoulder, and descending on
the legs. Elephants live in herds, and each herd has a leader&mdash;generally
the largest and most powerful animal&mdash;who exercises much control over
the herd, directing its movements, and giving the signal in the case of
danger. The trunk of the Elephant is of great service to it, and is a
wonderful combination of muscle; Curier, the famous Naturalist, stating
that there is not far short of 40,000 muscles, having distinct action,
and so giving it an acute sense of touch and smell&mdash;so much so, that it
can pick up a pin, or pluck the smallest leaf. The Elephant is generally
about ten feet high, and sometimes reaches to twelve feet, and lives to
the age of seventy or eighty years.</p>

<h2><a name="TIMOTHY" id="TIMOTHY"></a>TIMOTHY.</h2>


<p class="cap">T</p><p>IMOTHY was our pet hedgehog. I bought him in Leadenhall Market, brought
him home, and put him into the back-garden, which is walled in. There,
to that extent, he had his liberty, and many, and many a time did I
watch him from my study window walking about in the twilight among the
grass, searching for worms and other insects. And very useful was he to
the plants by so doing. When the dry weather came food got more scarce;
then Timothy was fed with bread and milk from the back-kitchen window,
which is on a level with the stone. Soon he came to know that when he
was hungry there was the supply; and often he would come and scratch at
the glass or at the back-door for his supper, and after getting it, walk
off to the garden beds to make himself useful. Few people know of the
great use of a hedgehog in a garden, or they would be more generally
kept. Our Timothy, poor fellow, however, in spite of all his good
qualities, came to a bad end. A strange dog coming one day, saw him
walking about in search of his accustomed food, and pounced on him and
bit him; still I had hopes of his recovery, but in a few days he died,
and all of us were sorry.</p>

written, owned a cockatoo, which he carried about with him on his
journeys; the bird's name was Billy, and he seems to have been as wise

a sharp, shrill cry of the bird, of &ldquo;Time to rise! time to rise!&rdquo;

looked around, wondering what had disturbed his feathered friend. The
cause was soon plain&mdash;a deadly snake lay coiled up close to his bed,
prepared to spring on the defenseless man. Just when he thought that all
hope was at an end, the brave cockatoo sprang from his perch, seized the

<p class="cap">I</p><p> was pike-fishing one season on the Dorset Stour below Canford Major,
when on passing from one field to another, I disturbed a hare. The
animal at once entered an open, dry drain, and I lost sight of her.
Presently, as I silently made my way plying my rod by the bank, I saw
her, this time without any appearance of alarm, take to the water, and
making her way through the sedges. She put her head to the stream so
that the force of the current, with but slight exertion by swimming on
her part, carried her nearly in a straight line to the opposite bank.
Here I watched her to see whether she would trundle herself like a dog,
but she merely rested a bit, letting the water run from her, and then
set off at a rattling pace across the mead, which doubtless soon
thoroughly dried her.</p>

<p class="cap">I</p><p> dare say you notice that all the birds in this picture have long
beaks. We may be sure from this that they live in places and seek for
their food in ways in which long beaks are just what they want. The fact
is they are all marsh birds, and the soil of marshes being wet and soft,
and full of worms, these long beaks enable them to probe it, and so get
at the worms. I think the beaks of birds afford a striking example of
how good God is in adapting creatures to the mode of life He has
appointed for them. The eagles and hawks, you know, are provided with
strong, short bills to enable them to seize and tear flesh. Those of
canaries and all the finches are just the very instruments to crack
seeds with. Parrots, with their tremendous weapons, can crush the
hardest nuts of the tropic forest. The crossbill is fitted with a
wonderful tool for tearing fir-cones to pieces. Robins and the other
warblers have soft bills, which are all they want for eating insects and
grubs.</p>

It goes out on the gang-plank, when a flock is to be loaded, to show

readily follows it on to the boat. The sheep, when in a flock, are all
alike timid, and it is difficult to find a leader among them, each being
afraid to go first; but when one goes, they all follow after, so that
this clever sheep is very valuable. The only other way to get a flock on

a good way as having the clever &ldquo;Pilot.&rdquo;</p>

at last put a strong collar round his neck, to which was attached a long
chain, and then we got him into a large barrel, and fastened the head on

then pulled to the quay, and hauled him up into a cart. For a time the

driven toward the city, and wanted to have a look round. I managed to
quiet him by giving him pieces of lump sugar. He arrived safely at the
Crystal Palace, and has lived in an aviary till the beginning of last

<p class="cap">A</p><p>MONG several curious habits of the woodcock, described by the editor of
the <i>Zoologist</i>, its practice of carrying its young is perhaps the most
interesting. The testimony of many competent witnesses is cited to
corroborate the statement. The late L. Lloyd, in his &ldquo;Scandinavian
Adventures,&rdquo; wrote, &ldquo;If, in shooting, you meet with a brood of
woodcocks, and the young ones cannot fly, the old bird takes them
separately between her feet, and flies from the dogs with a moaning
cry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The same author makes a similar statement in another work, this habit of
the woodcock having been observed by a friend.</p>

<p>One of the brothers Stuart gives, in &ldquo;Lays of the Deer Forest,&rdquo;  a
graphic account of the performance. He says, &ldquo;As the nests are laid on
dry ground, and often at a distance from moisture, in the latter case,
as soon as the young are hatched, the old bird will sometimes carry them
in her claws to the nearest spring or green strip. In the same manner,
when in danger, she will rescue those which she can lift; of this we
have frequent opportunities for observation in Tarnaway. Various times
when the hounds, in beating the ground, have come upon a brood, we have
seen the old bird rise with the young one in her claws and carry it
fifty or a hundred yards away.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="cap">H</p><p>AS any one ever told you that they were &ldquo;happy as a lark,&rdquo;  and have you
stopped to think how happy a lark is?&mdash;its joyous flight up into the
sky, as high or higher than the sight of man can reach, singing louder
and louder, and more and more gayly the higher it ascends? When the
sweet hay-time comes on, and mowers are busy in the fields with their
great scythes, it is sometimes a dangerous season for larks, who make
their nests on the ground. Often the poor little nests must suffer; but
only think how ingenious their owners are if they do. A mower once cut
off the upper part of a lark's nest. The lark sitting in it was
uninjured. The man was very sorry for what he had done; but there was no
help for it&mdash;at least so he thought. The lark knew better, and soon
afterward a beautiful dome was found made of grass over the nest by the
patient, brave bird.</p>

his knapsack on his back and his stick in his hand. He lodged most of
time in the cottages that he fell in with on his road. In one of them
there was a seal, which the fisherman had found on the sand, after
harpooning the mother of the poor animal. No sooner was it admitted into
the cottage than the seal became the friend of the family and the
playmate of the children. It played from morning till night with them,
would lick their hands, and call them with a gentle little cry, which is
not unlike the human voice, and it would look at them tenderly with its
large blue eyes, shaded by long black lashes. It almost always followed
its master to fish, swimming around the boat and taking a great many
fish, which it delivered to the fisherman without even giving them a
bite. A dog could not have been more devoted, faithful, teachable, or
even more intelligent.</p>

into the farm-yard, where she was, and finding that all was right,
returned to his old position before the fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="cap">O</p><p>NE day Mr. Edward, the Scotch naturalist shot at a Tern, hoping to
secure the beautiful creature as a specimen. The ball broke the bird's
wing, and he fell screaming down to the water. His cries brought other
terns to the rescue, and with pitiful screams they flew to the spot
where the naturalist stood, while the tide drifted their wounded brother
toward the shore. But before Mr. Edward could secure his prize, he
observed, to his astonishment, that two of the terns had flown down to
the water, and were gently lifting up their suffering companion, one
taking hold of either wing. But their burden was rather heavy; so, after
carrying it seaward about six or seven yards, they let it down, and two
more came, picked it up, and carried it a little farther. By means of
thus relieving each other they managed to reach a rock where they
concluded they would be safe.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_OTTER" id="THE_OTTER"></a>THE OTTER.</h2>


<p class="cap">T</p><p>HE Otter belongs to a class of animals which we may call the Weasel
tribe. Their bodies are long and lithe, and their legs short. This
family includes the weasel (its smallest member), the stoat, the ferret,
the pole-cat, the marten, and the otter (its largest member). You may
then think of the Otter as a water-ferret, or water-weasel. He can swim
most elegantly, and he is a beautiful diver. Let a fish glide underneath
him, and he is after it in a moment; and as the fish darts here and
there to escape, the Otter follows each rapid movement with unerring
precision. When the fish is caught, the Otter carries it to the bank and
makes a meal. But the Otter is like naughty Jack who leaves a saucy
plate&mdash;he spoils much more fish than he eats. The trout and other fish
are so much alarmed at the appearance of an Otter, that they will
sometimes fling themselves on the bank to get out of his way.</p>

him. Notwithstanding his commanding appearance, and the strictness with
which he guards the property of his master, the mastiff is possessed of
great mildness of character, and is very grateful for any favors
bestowed upon him. I once went into the barn of a friend where there was
a mastiff chained; I went up to the dog and patted him on the head, when
out rushed the groom from the stable exclaiming, &ldquo;Come away, sir! He's
dangerous with strangers.&rdquo; But I did not remove my hand nor show any
fear. The consequence was, that the dog and I were the best of friends;
but had I shown any fear, and hastily removed my hand, I might have

their instinct. On the back lawn at a gentleman's house, they have a
feeding-box for the pheasants, which opens on their perching upon it,
but remains shut if any lesser bird than a hen pheasant perches there,
which saves the contents from the thefts of these, and of rats, mice,
and other vermin. But the gentleman discovered that the contents of the
box was being more rapidly emptied than the wants of the pheasants
warranted. So he kept a watch on the box, and soon discovered a
wood-pigeon perch on the box, but his weight not being sufficient to
open the lid, he beckoned to another pigeon, and their combined weight
made the lid fly open, and after each had taken what they required, they
flew away, and the box closed with a &ldquo;click.&rdquo;</p>

very large and wonderful reptiles. Of them we present striking
illustrations. One of them has been named the Ichthyosaurus, which means
Fish Reptile. Its head somewhat resembled that of the crocodile, except
that the orbit was much larger, and had the nostril placed close to it,
as in the whale, and not near the end of the snout. It had four paddles
and a powerful tail, and was very active in its movements and a rapid
swimmer.</p>

<p>The other huge reptile was the Plesiosaurus, the meaning of which is
&ldquo;Near to a Reptile.&rdquo; Its structure was very singular and its character
very strange. In the words of Buckland: &ldquo;To the head of a lizard, it
united the teeth of the crocodile, a neck of enormous length, resembling
the body of a serpent, a trunk and a tail of the size of an ordinary
quadruped, the ribs of a chameleon, and the paddles of a whale.&rdquo;</p>

husband is busy with some other part of the duties of tending the sheep.
It is often painful to see how much the poor sheep and oxen suffer while
being driven through the streets. It is pitiful to see them looking in
vain for some place of rest and shelter. Little boys in towns sometimes
like to HELP&mdash;as they call it&mdash;to drive cattle, but they generally
increase the terror and confusion of the poor beasts, and little think
of the pain they are causing. Sheep and goats are very useful to us;
besides serving us for food, they supply our cloth and flannel clothes,

turned and made at it with its wings down, then rolled over, then ran,
and again rushed at the dog. I drove the dog away, when I was surprised
to see a number of young partridges running from behind the old bird who
had been trying to protect them from the dog, and guarding their
retreat. So you see how brave the most timid creatures become when in
danger, and when their young are near. Instinct tells them that they
have to protect their little ones, and risk everything, even their own
lives, for their safety. We can get beautiful lessons every day from the
birds and poor dumb animals, if we only study them as we ought.</p>

<p class="cap">V</p><p>ERY pretty birds were Mr. and Mrs. Kingfisher, with dark, glossy, green
wings, spotted with light blue. Their tails were also light blue, and
there was a patch of yellow near their heads. The little Kingfishers
were quite as pretty as their parents, and Mr. and Mrs. Kingfisher were
exceedingly proud of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only they eat a great deal,&rdquo;  said Mr. Kingfisher; &ldquo;I am getting very
tired.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For Mr. Kingfisher had been flying backward and forward all day, and it
was surprising to see the quantity of fish he caught for his family.</p>

<p>When he built his nest he took care that it should be near a stream, and
he found one close by a high cliff that Mrs. Kingfisher said would be
just the place; so they scooped out a deep hole, and there the eggs were
laid, and in due time six little Kingfishers burst out of the shells.</p>

<h2><a name="RATS_CARRYING_EGGS_UP_STAIRS" id="RATS_CARRYING_EGGS_UP_STAIRS"></a>RATS CARRYING EGGS UP STAIRS.</h2>


<p class="cap">R</p><p>ATS are very ingenious little creatures; they have actually been known
to convey eggs up a staircase, from the pantry to their nest! Here is a
beautiful picture, by Mr. Harrison Weir, from the &ldquo;Children's Friend,&rdquo;
showing how they did it.</p>

<p>The rat bears little resemblance to the rats with which we are chiefly
acquainted, namely, the black rat, the albino or white rat, and the
brown rat. The other day, as I was walking by the river-side, I saw a
beautiful little creature sitting on a stone in the stream, with a piece
of succulent root between its forepaws, and nibbling its repast in
perfect peace with every living thing. It was timid and innocent in the
expression of its countenance. Its color was of a reddish brown. It was
about as large as the common rat of the sewers, but its tail was much
shorter, and covered with hair.</p>

<h2><a name="A_HERON_ATTACKED_BY_A_HAWK" id="A_HERON_ATTACKED_BY_A_HAWK"></a>A HERON ATTACKED BY A HAWK.</h2>


<p class="cap">T</p><p>HE Heron when attacked by an eagle or falcon endeavors to escape by
rising in the air and getting above its foe. The wings of the heron
strike the air with an equal and regular motion which raises its body to
such an elevation that at a distance nothing is seen except the wings,
which are at last lost sight of in the region of the clouds.</p>

<p>If its enemy gets above it, and upon or near its body, it defends itself
vigorously with its long and powerful beak, and often comes off
victorious.</p>

<p>The heron frequents the neighborhood of rivers and lakes. Almost always
solitary, it remains for hours motionless on the same spot. When seeking
the fish or frogs on which it chiefly feeds, the heron wades into the
water, folds its long neck partially over its back and forward again,
and with watchful eye waits till a fish comes within reach of its beak,
when it darts its head into the water and secures its slimy, slippery
prey.</p>

<h2><a name="A_HORSE_GUARDIAN" id="A_HORSE_GUARDIAN"></a>A HORSE GUARDIAN.</h2>


<p class="cap">O</p><p>N one occasion a gentleman was returning home from a fatiguing journey,
and became very drowsy. He fell asleep, and, strange to say, he also
fell from his saddle, but in so easy a manner that the tumble did not
rouse him, and lay sleeping on where he alighted. His faithful steed, on
being eased of his burden, instead of scampering home as one might have
expected, stood by his prostrate master, and kept a strict watch over
him. Some laborers at sunrise found him very contentedly snoozing on a
heap of stones. They wished to approach the gentleman, that they might
awaken him, but every attempt on their part was resolutely opposed by
the grinning teeth and ready heels of his determined and faithful
guardian. They called out loudly, and the gentleman awoke and was very
much surprised at his position, while his faithful horse showed his
pleasure by neighing and scraping his feet on the ground. The gentleman
then mounted, and they galloped away at great speed, both glad to be
able to make up for lost time.</p>

<p class="cap">A</p><p> fierce battle between a fox and a swan took place at Sherborne Park.
Master Reynard seems to have caught the old swan napping, and to have
seized him by the throat. The bird defended himself with his wings so
powerfully that its assailant was done to death in no time, and a
workman going past the lake above the bridge next morning found both fox
and swan lying dead together. The bird had received a fatal bite in the
throat; the fox had one leg broken and the side of its head completely
broken in. The swan was the oldest bird on the lake.</p>

<h2><a name="TOUSY" id="TOUSY"></a>TOUSY.</h2>


<p class="cap">W</p><p>E have a beautiful long-haired little dog called Tousy, which lately
had a pup. This queer little bantling was jumping and tumbling about the
green one day, when a lady entered followed by a dog. Tousy made a
ferocious assault on the four-footed stranger, by way of defending her
young, and our magnificent white cat, which was sitting on the doorstep,
seeing or supposing that his friend Tousy was in danger, made two
immense bounds, and alighted on the back of the intruder, whose eyes
would have been scratched out but for prompt rescue. The mutual
affection of these two animals is unbounded, and yet we hear human
disagreements compared to cat-and-dog life! These animals, and many
others, are capable of the most devoted affection to their young, and to
their mates, and frequently teach us lessons of kindness to one
another.</p>
